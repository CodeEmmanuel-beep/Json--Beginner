# Json--Beginner
This repo contains a sales calculator, which stores the result with JSON for reference and auditing purposes
it is me, combining the calculator program with file i/o baseic, here the calculator does not only calculate sales, it stores the results in an accountable manner in a JSON file
Called.py contains the function for the program
DO.py is the program, you can select the number of calculations you want to calculate and there is a seperate operations for days, weeks or currents, if the user wants to calculate his sales ffor the weeks he should type days and it will limit his input to 7 because seven days make one weekz, if he wants to calculate weekly sales, he should type weeks and his input will be limited to 4, becauses four weeks makes a month, but if he does not want limits he should type current. this calculator even handle taxes'
Shaw.py is the json file in which the results are recorded, including the time for each operations, the operations and result in an orderly manner
